# Windows Log Analysis â€“ Privileged Logons

As part of my studies on log analysis and incident detection, I performed a test using the Windows Event Viewer.

## What Did I Learn?

Using the Event Viewer, I was able to monitor and analyze different types of system events.

In this case, I focused on two specific log IDs:

- **4624** â€“ Successful Logon  
- **4672** â€“ Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon

These events are crucial in identifying potential privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized access.

## Analysis Summary

I noticed a high frequency of events 4624 and 4672 occurring in short time intervals.  
To investigate, I reviewed the origin of the logons and confirmed they were generated by legitimate system activity on my own machine.

## Conclusion

There was no indication of an attack.  
The logons were internal, expected, and part of regular system operations.  
This exercise helped reinforce my ability to identify normal vs suspicious behavior through event log analysis.
