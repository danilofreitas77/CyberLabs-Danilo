# Room 02 - SOC & Defensive Security (TryHackMe)

## Overview

This room introduced the role of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** and the fundamentals of defensive cybersecurity.  
The focus was on detecting real threats among alerts, analyzing logs, and performing simple incident response actions.

## What I Did

- Learned what a SOC is and how it monitors and defends organizational IT environments.
- Reviewed different types of security alerts and learned to distinguish false positives from real threats.
- Analyzed simulated security logs to identify malicious activity.
- Took defensive action by blocking suspicious IP addresses to prevent attacks.
- Experienced the first steps of incident detection and response.

## Tools & Techniques

- Log analysis for security event identification.
- Basic understanding of firewalls and IP blocking.
- Use of alert triage processes in a SOC environment.

## Key Takeaways

- Defensive security relies on continuous monitoring and quick response.
- Not every alert is dangerous; skill is needed to prioritize threats.
- Blocking IPs and other mitigation techniques are essential first responses.
- Working in a SOC requires attention to detail and proactive defense.
