# Room 01 - Introduction to Cyber Security (TryHackMe)

## Overview

This room introduces **Offensive Security**, which is about thinking like a hacker to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.  

The goal was to perform a controlled, ethical hack on a vulnerable web application to understand penetration testing basics.

## What I Did

- Learned the concept of Offensive Security: simulating hacker actions to test system defenses.
- Used the command-line tool **gobuster** to perform brute-force URL discovery on a fake banking website called *FakeBank*.
- Discovered a hidden page on the website by brute-forcing URLs.
- Accessed a restricted page to simulate a money transfer, mimicking how an attacker could exploit web vulnerabilities.
- Practiced how ethical hackers find weaknesses to help developers fix them.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Gobuster:** a brute-force tool used to discover hidden URLs or directories on websites.
- Manual URL manipulation in the browser to access restricted pages.
- Basic command line usage in a Linux-like environment.

## Key Takeaways

- Offensive Security is proactive and focused on discovering weaknesses before attackers.
- Using automated tools combined with manual exploration helps find hidden attack surfaces.
- Ethical hacking is legal and safe when done in controlled environments.
- This lab gave a first-hand experience of what penetration testers do in the real world.
